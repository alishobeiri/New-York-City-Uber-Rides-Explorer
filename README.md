**New York City Uber Rides Explorer**
This app is based off of data provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data) and highlights Uber trips taken in New York City from April 2014 to September 2014.

The app allows you to filter by time of day and shows a histogram of Uber ride activity over the course of 24 hours. I also attached a series of different points of interest that I thought would be cool to check out, these can be seen in the buttons that are overlayed onto the map. 

The following are screenshots for the app in this repo:
